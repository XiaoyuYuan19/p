## Research & Projects

#### High-Precision Visual SLAM for GI Endoscopy Navigation
*Master Thesis, University of Helsinki*
* Developed a deep learning-enhanced framework for **ORB-SLAM3** to achieve robust localization in challenging GI environments.
* Integrated a **Transformer-based depth estimation model** and a **dual-attention U-Net** to significantly improve depth perception and trajectory accuracy.
* Gained experience with remote GPU and HPC services for large-scale experiments.

#### Enhancement Proposal for PANNZER via Protein Language Models
*Self-Initiated Literature-Based Project*
* Performed a literature-based analysis of the PANNZER protein function prediction pipeline.
* Proposed a novel research direction integrating **Transformer-based protein language models (e.g., ProtBERT, ESM)** to enhance performance and discussed these ideas with the original authors, Prof. Liisa Holm and Dr. Petri Törönen.
