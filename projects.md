## üöÄ Research & Featured Projects

#### **High-Precision Visual SLAM for GI Endoscopy Navigation** (Master Thesis)
* Developed a deep learning-enhanced framework for **ORB-SLAM3** to achieve robust localization in challenging GI environments.
* Integrated a **Transformer-based depth estimation model** and a **dual-attention U-Net** to significantly improve depth perception and trajectory accuracy.

#### **Ancient Character Recognition with Transformer-based OCR** (Bachelor Thesis)
* Led the full lifecycle of an OCR system for the ancient **Houma Alliance Book texts**, from building a custom dataset to deploying a real-time web application.
* This work resulted in **two international conference papers**, one software copyright, and one patent.
* üèÜ **1st Prize**, Chinese Collegiate Computing Competition (National-Level) & **2nd Prize**, Jiangsu Province Bachelor Thesis Award.
* üé• **[YouTube Demo]([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myvIOghtj1k&t=14s))**

#### **Preference Optimization in LLM: RLHF & DPO Exploration**
* Conducted a self-initiated study on **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)**, including mathematical derivations and visualizations to compare its stability and complexity with RLHF.

#### **Enhancement Proposal for PANNZER via Protein Language Models**
* Performed a literature-based analysis of the PANNZER protein function prediction pipeline.
* Proposed a novel research direction integrating **Transformer-based protein language models (e.g., ProtBERT, ESM)** to enhance performance, and discussed these ideas with the original authors.
