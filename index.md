## About Me

I am a researcher passionate about building **Trustworthy and Explainable AI**. My journey has taken me from deciphering ancient scripts with **Transformer-based OCR** to pioneering **high-precision visual SLAM for medical navigation**. These experiences have solidified my focus on the critical intersection of AI safety, reliability, and human-AI interaction.

Currently, I am a Master's student in Computer Science at the **University of Helsinki**, where I was awarded a full scholarship. My work explores how to make AI systems more robust and interpretable, particularly in high-stakes domains. I am actively seeking a PhD position where I can contribute to advancing the methodologies for safe and reliable AI.
