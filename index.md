### About Me

I am a researcher passionate about building **Trustworthy and Explainable AI**. [cite_start]My journey has taken me from deciphering ancient scripts with **Transformer-based OCR** [cite: 37] [cite_start]to developing **high-precision visual SLAM for medical navigation**[cite: 28, 34]. These experiences have solidified my focus on the critical intersection of AI safety, reliability, and human-AI interaction.

[cite_start]Currently, I am a Master's student in Computer Science at the **University of Helsinki**, where I was awarded a full scholarship[cite: 5, 7]. My work explores how to make AI systems more robust and interpretable, particularly in high-stakes domains like medical imaging and natural language understanding. I am actively seeking a PhD position where I can contribute to advancing the methodologies for safe and reliable AI.
